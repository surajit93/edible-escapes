    <h1>The Hungry Compass – Chapter 1</h1>
    <h2>Four Friends. Infinite Miles. Countless Meals.</h2>

    <p>Raj leaned back on the bamboo recliner, wiped his brow, and muttered,</p>
    <p class="dialogue">"Hot. Too hot. Like a bloody tandoor. Bro, why are we here again?"</p>

    <p>Arko, lying belly-down on the porch floor drawing mountain outlines in his notebook, chuckled,</p>
    <p class="dialogue">"It’s called the art of suffering in silence. You city types wouldn’t understand."</p>
    <p>He flicked a pebble toward a chicken, which fluffed up and fled indignantly.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"No AC, no waterfall, no breeze, no WiFi. You call this vacation?"</p>
    <p>Raj grumbled, sipping warm coconut water straight from the nut.</p>

    <p>Sayan emerged from inside, holding a rusted bicycle bell. "This thing still works. Found it near the papaya tree."</p>

    <p>Raj frowned. "We’ve been in this village for five days. I have mosquito tattoos on my back."</p>

    <p>"I heard about a place in Meghalaya," said Ron, who had just returned with two boiled eggs, a sketchpad, and a half-drunk Frooti. "Cleanest village in Asia. Mawlynnong. Bamboo bridges. Pork curry. Local rice beer."</p>

    <p>Raj sat upright. "Did you say beer?"</p>
    <p>Sayan’s eyes twitched with excitement. "Did he say pork?"</p>
    <p>Ron smirked. "I also heard about a waterfall nearby where mist looks like it’s dancing."</p>

    <p>Raj jumped. "I’m sold. Let’s bounce. Jeep?"</p>
    <p>"Or hitchhike," Arko said.</p>
    <p>"Last time I sat on a sack of onions for four hours," Raj groaned.</p>
    <p>"You still smell like onion sweat," Sayan teased, dodging Raj’s flip-flop.</p>

    <p>They packed like men on a quest, not tourists:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A tattered map with scribbled notes</li>
      <li>One steel kettle</li>
      <li>Arko’s tiny Bluetooth speaker</li>
      <li>Ron’s flea-market camera</li>
      <li>Sayan’s audio recorder</li>
      <li>A torn novel</li>
      <li>Two loaves of stale bread</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The road to Mawlynnong was greener than a spinach smoothie. Every now and then someone would yell,</p>
    <p class="dialogue">"Stop!"</p>
    <p>They’d jump out of the slow-moving tempo to take photos of trees that looked like dancers or dogs that looked like philosophers.</p>

    <p>By late afternoon, they rolled into the village. It smelled like turmeric, bamboo, and wet earth. Children ran past with bamboo hoops. Women sat on porches weaving baskets under mango trees.</p>

    <p>A smoky shack lured them in. A Khasi woman stirred something heavenly.</p>

    <p>She served them smoked pork with mustard leaves, bamboo shoot chutney, and wild black rice.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"This. This is religion," Raj whispered after a bite.</p>
    <p class="dialogue">"This is heaven with chili flakes," said Sayan, mouth full.</p>

    <p>That night, they pitched a tent beside a stream. Ron lit a fire, Arko played jazz, and Raj fell asleep hugging a bottle of rice beer.</p>

    <p>At dawn, they hiked to the living root bridge. Roots twisted across a stream like ancient snakes. Mist floated over mossy stones like soft ghosts.</p>

    <p>On the other side, a man roasted meat over open flame.</p>
    <p class="dialogue">"Jadoh with pork liver,"</p>
    <p>he said, handing out skewers. Also rice, steamed inside bamboo tubes.</p>

    <p>The flavors were wild and spicy. The man waved away cameras. "Only taste. No photos."</p>

    <p>They didn’t check into hotels. Instead, they asked a shopkeeper if they could sleep on his granary roof. "Only if you clean my courtyard," he said.</p>
    <p>"Deal," Sayan replied instantly.</p>

    <p>At 6 AM, fog hung like thick soup. They cleaned leaves, laughed, and debated who snores loudest.</p>

    <p>Ron scratched his stubble. "Where next?"</p>
    <p>"Nongriat," Arko said. "Hidden waterfall. Locals make something called kiat – a fermented brew from fruit skins."</p>

    <p>Raj asked, "Can we swim?"</p>
    <p>"Always," Sayan grinned.</p>

    <p>On the trail, a child invited them to meet her grandmother who sings for guests. In a dim hut, an elderly woman tapped a tin plate and sang of clouds falling in love with rocks. Ron recorded it for their blog.</p>

    <p>Later, they cooked rice and roasted jackfruit seeds with mustard oil and salt.</p>

      "This is better than Goa," Raj whispered under the stars.

    <p>"No crowd. No noise. No exes," Arko muttered. "Only pork and poetry."</p>

    <p>They started talking about the next leg—Vietnam.</p>

    <p>"Beer so fresh, it’s brewed in front of you," said Sayan.</p>
    <p>"Pho. Hot. Smoky. Like soul soup," added Ron.</p>
    <p>"Floating markets!" Arko chimed in.</p>

    <p>"We need a name," Ron said.</p>
    <p>"‘Fork Nomads’?" Arko offered. "‘Broth & Boots’? No, wait... ‘Hungry Compass,’" Sayan declared.</p>

    <p>They all nodded. The journey had just begun.</p>
